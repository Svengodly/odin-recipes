    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Originating from the Japanese cuisine, the okonomiyaki is generally described as a savory pancake. It consists of wheat flour and cabbage 
        alongside other accoutrements such as beef or seafood. You might say that having a pancake without syrup, fruit, chocolate chips, or any other 
        decadent topping is sacrilege but the okonomiyaki will not disappoint.

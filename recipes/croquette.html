    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Originating from the French cuisine, croquettes consist of what is called a binder which is an outside coating made of
        potatoes or wheat flour. Croquettes have a filling on the inside which may be cheese, meat, or vegies. They are kind of like
         Rice Balls, but minus the rice.
